# Last-ite-Convergence-in-EFGs-Experiments

This is the repository for the experiments in the paper **Learning Imperfect Information Extensive-form Games with Last-iterate Convergence under Bandit Feedback** (ICML 2025).

This codebase is built upon the implementation from [IIG-tree-adaptation](https://github.com/anon17893/IIG-tree-adaptation), with our main contribution being the addition of a new algorithm:

- `OMD with Virtual Transition Weighted Negentropy Regularization`: A novel Online Mirror Descent algorithm incorporating virtual transitions and weighted negentropy regularization for Last-iterate Convergence in imperfect information games.
